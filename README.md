This repository contains examples of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts implemented in C++

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around objects and data rather than actions and logic. It focuses on creating reusable and modular code through the use of classes and objects.

Features
Classes: Define blueprints for creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior.
Objects: Instances of classes that interact with each other through methods.
Encapsulation: Bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data, restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
Inheritance: Mechanism by which one class can inherit properties and behavior from another class.
Polymorphism: Ability of objects to take on many forms, depending on context. It allows methods to be written that can be used with objects of various types.
